TABARI-Code
===========

Source code for the TABARI C++ event coding program. This is a GitHub mirror for the code found at 

http://eventdata.parusanalytics.com/software.dir/tabari.html

The TABARI program has generally been superseded by the PETRARCH coder and we are no longer actively working on it: details on that transition are described here:

http://eventdata.parusanalytics.com/tabari.dir/petrarch.html

The TABARI code might still be of interest if you are looking for a high-speed coder and/or wish to avoid using the Stanford CoreNLP parser. 

A collection of dictionaries for TABARI can be found at 

https://github.com/philip-schrodt/TABARI-Dictionaries

and a more extensive set incorporated into the various data sets at 

http://eventdata.parusanalytics.com/data.html

However, these have not been updated since about 2012. The newer PETRARCH dictionaries can be found at

https://github.com/openeventdata/Dictionaries

These are not directly compatible with TABARI but if you are the sort of person who is browsing GitHub, it would be relatively straightforward to convert them.
